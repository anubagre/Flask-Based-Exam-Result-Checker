# Flask-Based Exam Result Checker

## Description
This is my first project using Flask, created for practice purposes. The website allows users to input marks for four subjects (Science, Maths, English and Hindi) and calculates the overall percentage to determine if the student has passed the exam.

## Running the Project Locally

To run this Flask-based Exam Result Checker locally, follow these steps:
